Before adding a new SSH key to your account on GitHub.com, complete the following steps.

Check for existing SSH keys. For more information, see Checking for existing SSH keys.
Generate a new SSH key and add it to your machine's SSH agent. For more information, see Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent.
Adding a new SSH key to your account
You can add an SSH key and use it for authentication, or commit signing, or both. If you want to use the same SSH key for both authentication and signing, you need to upload it twice.

After adding a new SSH authentication key to your account on GitHub.com, you can reconfigure any local repositories to use SSH. For more information, see Managing remote repositories.

Note

GitHub improved security by dropping older, insecure key types on March 15, 2022.

As of that date, DSA keys (ssh-dss) are no longer supported. You cannot add new DSA keys to your personal account on GitHub.

RSA keys (ssh-rsa) with a valid_after before November 2, 2021 may continue to use any signature algorithm. RSA keys generated after that date must use a SHA-2 signature algorithm. Some older clients may need to be upgraded in order to use SHA-2 signatures.

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
Note

With Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can use clip.exe. Otherwise if clip isn't working, you can locate the hidden .ssh folder, open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.
On newer versions of Windows that use the Windows Terminal, or anywhere else that uses the PowerShell command line, you may receive a ParseError stating that The '&lt;' operator is reserved for future use. In this case, the following alternative clip command should be used:
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile picture, then click  Settings.

In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  SSH and GPG keys.

Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.

In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, if you're using a personal laptop, you might call this key "Personal laptop".

Select the type of key, either authentication or signing. For more information about commit signing, see About commit signature verification.

In the "Key" field, paste your public key.

Click Add SSH key.

If prompted, confirm access to your account on GitHub. For more information, see Sudo mode.S
